# JavaScript Learning Exercises

A beginner-friendly collection of small JavaScript examples and exercises, organized by topic. This repo is intended for practice, demonstrations, and quick experiments while learning core JavaScript concepts.

## Repository structure

- `01_basics/` — variables, data types, conversions, comparisons, strings, numbers, dates, and a `test.js` playground.
- `02_basics/` — array and object examples and exercises.
- `03_basics/` — functions, scopes, and arrow function examples.
- `04_control_flow/` — `if`/`else`, `switch`, and truthy/falsy examples.
- `05_iterations/` — iteration examples using loops and iterators.

Files are named to group related lessons; open any `.js` file to read the example and run it with Node.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Node.js (v12+ recommended).

Run a single example with:

```bash
node 01_basics/01_variables.js
```

Run the simple playground/test file:

```bash
node 01_basics/test.js
```

Open any example in a browser or in VS Code to tinker interactively.

## Learning goals

- Reinforce core JavaScript concepts through small, focused examples.
- Provide quick, copyable snippets to modify and experiment with.

## Contributing

- Submit issues or pull requests with improvements, new examples, or corrections.
- Keep examples small, well-named, and focused on one concept per file.

If you want, I can help add a CONTRIBUTING.md, a simple test runner, or example solutions.
